# ConversionAPI
This all started with my dad having a spreadsheet with conversions.  I wanted a better way to use them and I've ported those conversions to a couple of languages, but this is an API written in Python to allow use from any language.

This is hosted in Docker Hub at https://hub.docker.com/r/themranderson/conversionapi and the configuration for the container is listed there as well.
