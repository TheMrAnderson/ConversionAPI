## Information

This all started with my dad having a spreadsheet with some weird and some not-so-weird conversions. I wanted a better way to use them and I ported them to a couple of languages over the years as needed. Now this is an API written in Python to allow use from any language and to stop porting to different languages. I've added quite a few as my needs changed.

## Usage

There is a Docker container at https://hub.docker.com/r/themranderson/conversionapi and the configuration for the container is listed there as well.
