# ConversionAPI

This all started with my dad having a spreadsheet with random conversions.  Some were weird and some were not so weird.  I have ported them to a couple of languages over the years as needed but now this is an API to allow use from any language and to stop porting to different languages. I've also added quite a few conversions as my needs changed, as well as some calculations that aren't conversions.  It's wrapped in a Docker container to make even easier to use in different places.

## Usage

Use the [Docker container](https://hub.docker.com/r/themranderson/conversionapi).

- Port 3000 is the default port the API uses
